        <p>Julius Caesar, beginning in 58 BC, waged a series of military campaigns against several Gallic Tribes.<sup id="fn3" class="footnote"><a href="/author#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>

        <p>At this time, the Gauls, a Celtic people, were living in the region roughly corresponding to what is now France, Belgium, Switzerland and Northern Italy.<sup id="fn4" class="footnote"><a href="/author#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>

        <p>These Gallic wars as they became known, ended in 52 BC with a Roman victory in the Battle of Alesia, led by none other than Julius Caesar<sup id="fn5" class="footnote"><a href="/author#fn5">[5]</a></sup> This was a significant military victory for the Romans, resulting in the expansion of the Roman Republic over the whole of Gaul, and pushing their northern border to the river Rhine.</p>

        <p>I am standing here at the mouth of the Oude Rijn, a branch of the Rhine river that flows through the Dutch provinces of Utrecht and South Holland. It is this river, that formed the Northern border of the Roman Empire around 52 BC.<sup id="fn7" class="footnote"><a href="/author#fn7">[7]</a></sup></p>

        <p>The northern border of the Roman Empire was known as the Limes Germanicus<sup id="fn8" class="footnote"><a href="/author#fn8">[8]</a></sup>, a line of fortifications that stretched from the North Sea at Katwik, following the natural boundary of the Lower Rhine branches, that included the modern Oude Rijn, and followed the Rhine to its source in the Swiss Alps.</p>
        <p>The Limes Germanicus was designed to protect the newly acquired lands from the raiding Germanic tribes from which I originate.</p>

        <p>For around 450 years, from around 55 BC to around 410 AD, the southern part of the Netherlands was integrated into the Roman Empire. During this time the Romans in the Netherlands had an enormous influence on the lives and culture of the people who lived in the Netherlands at the time and (indirectly) on the generations that followed.</p>
        <p>So, I was born within 30Km of the northern border of the Roman Empire.</p>
