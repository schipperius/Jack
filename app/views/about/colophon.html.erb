        <p>After the primary tools have been installed, I had to set up specific tools to actually build the website. The Book of Jack was built using Ruby on Rails, so I had to create a Ruby environment by installing the following secondary development tools, in the same order listed here. </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://beginrescueend.com/">RVM</a> is a command-line tool which allows you to easily install, manage, and work with multiple ruby environments from interpreters to sets of gems.</li>
          <li><a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.</li>
          <li><a href="http://rubygems.org/">Rubygems</a> is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries (in a self-contained format called a "gem"), a tool designed to easily manage the installation of gems, and a server for distributing them.</li>

        <p>Next up, is to initiate a new rails app and set up the rails environment by installing specific rubygems, a highly customizable process in which no two websites would have the exact same requirements.</p>
        <p>This process will be commented on in a future article, in the meantime you can browse the <a href="https://github.com/schipperius/Jack/blob/master/Gemfile" target="_blank">Gemfile</a> for this project, you won't get a feel for the process, but you will see a list of the gems involved.</p>

        <p>Finally, the production website needs to be deployed, which I have not yet even begun. (What you are currently seeing is the production website hosted by Heroku for testing purposes.) A future article on this process is also forthcoming.</p>

        <p>As you can see, getting a website up and running can be a daunting process and has required a tremendous amount of time and effort. It's not for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_fibrillation" target="_blank">faint of heart</a>, that's for sure!</p>
