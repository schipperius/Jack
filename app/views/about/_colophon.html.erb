    <p>Setting up my work environment required the installation of a number of, what I refer to, as primary development tools:

    <p>The Book of Jack was built with Ruby on Rails, and before I could get started, I had to create the Ruby environment by installing the following secondary tools.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://beginrescueend.com/">RVM</a> is a command-line tool which allows you to easily install, manage, and work with multiple ruby environments from interpreters to sets of gems.</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.</li>
      <li><a href="http://rubygems.org/">Rubygems</a> is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries (in a self-contained format called a "gem"), a tool designed to easily manage the installation of gems, and a server for distributing them.</li>
      <li><a href="rubyonrails">Rails</a> is an open source full-stack web application framework for the Ruby programming language.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Next up, is to initiate a new rails app and set up the rails environment by installing specific rubygems, which is a highly customizable process, no two websites have the same requirements.</p>
    <p>This process will b commented on in a future article.</p>
    <p>Finally, the website needs to be deployed, which I have not yet begun. A future article on this process will also be forthcoming.</p>
    <p>As you can see, getting a website up and running can be a daunting process and has required a tremendous amount of time and effort. It's not for the faint of heart, that's for sure!</p>
