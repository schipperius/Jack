        <p>I live in Calgary Canada. I have worked in the eduction industry for more than twenty years in both the public and private sectors including K&#045;12 and post-secondary environments.</p>

        <p>I currently manage the computer application and technology programs at University of Calgary Continuing Education. You can read more about me on <%= link_to "LinkedIn",
        "http://ca.linkedin.com/in/schipperius", :target => "_blank", :title => "LinkedIn" %>.</p>

        <p>A few years ago, I didn&rsquo;t know what an HTML tag was, I thought I should learn, so I bought Elizabeth Castro&rsquo;s HTML and CSS QuickStart book and have since read over 120 web design and development books along with countless online articles, tutorials and videocasts.</p>

        <p>The Book of Jack website represents the culmination of what I have learned over the last few years.</p>

        <p>My workplace is a <strong>studio</strong> where I have <strong>designed</strong> and built the <a href="#">Book of Jack</a>.</p>

        <p>By <strong>integrating</strong> design and development tools, methodologies, techniques and technologies, I am completing my life&rsquo;s work.</p>
