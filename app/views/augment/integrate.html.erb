  <h3>Content Architecture</h3>

      <p>The concept for the Book of Jack came from me, Mark Schipper <sup id="fnref:1.3" class="footnote"><a href="/about#fn:1.3">[3]</a></sup>, the content was researched, written and rewritten numerous times over the years, and it appears that this book may never really be finished which became the main reason for adding it to the Internet.</p>

      <p>The process of learning how to build a Website from scratch has been a journey of its own and has exposed me to an amazing technological world that required learning the content of well over 100 Web design and development books! <sup id="fnref:1.4" class="footnote"><a href="/about#fn:1.4">[4]</a></sup></p>

      <p>As such, my knowledge and skills have grown to a point where I can now comfortably discuss the following technical aspects of building this site, and yet there is still so much to learn.</p>

      <p>I realized that this book would have to be distributed in a electronic format, the problem was, I didn't know how to do that.</p>

  <h3>Web Design and Development</h3>
  <section class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4 columns">
      <p>Initially I began building some simple pages using a Windows PC and Microsoft's Notepad, I outgrew Notepad and migrated to Adobe Dreamweaver, building static pages while learning HTML, CSS and simple design concepts such as layout, colour, and typography. At this same time, I also began learning the fundamentals of Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop for some visual treatments.</p>

      <p>I began adding simple front-end behaviours with JavaScript and soon jumped into the Yahoo! User Interface, my first JavaScript library, and was pleasantly surprised with the improved functionality I was able to add, like drop-down menus, tabs, and accordions. During this time, I also began learning a number of Google products like Maps, Search and AdSense, and I began using Firefox tools like web developer and firebug.</p>

      <p>I then added Apache, MySQL and PHP and began building some limited dynamic pages but was quite overwhelmed with all of the tools, technologies and methodologies I needed to learn. I had rewritten the Book of Jack several times already, I did not know anything about versioning, but by this time, I was probably on version 6.3.15 build 2387 :)</p>

    <div class="span4 columns">
      <p>Then I bought an Apple iMac and I discovered how much fun web design and development really is!</p>

      <p>My current design and development environment consists of Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for digital imagery and drawing, HTML5 and CSS3 are being used as much as the current browsers will allow and the preferred JavaScript library is jQuery 1.4.2.</p>
      <p>Textmate a text editor is used to edit text, and iTerm, a command-line terminal is used to issue commands. The Web browser of choice is Firefox with several add-ons like Firebug, YSlow and the Web Developer Toolbar. I have the Ruby Version Manger installed but I stick with Ruby 1.9.2 and Rails 3.x.x. My version control system is Git and I push my code to GitHub which makes it very easy to deploy my test environment to Heroku.</p>

      <p>With everything in place, I decided to turn this book into a social networking site, where I could provide some of the background context and users could sign up and add their own content and in so doing, maybe this book will be complete one day after all.</p>
