      <p>This photograph is of a Geneva Bible that was printed in 1581. <sup id="fnref:1.2" class="footnote"><a href="/about#fn:1.2">2</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>A little blasphemous maybe, but it&#039;s as good a place to start as any.... You see, the letter &#147;j&#148; is absent from this bible, it hadn&#039;t even been invented yet&#033; <sup id="fnref:1.3" class="footnote"><a href="/about#fn:1.3">3</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>I&#039;m wondering how they spelled Jesus, Jacob and Jerusalem&#063; And, if they didn&#039;t use the letter &#147;J&#148;, which has a &#147;dzh&#148; sound, how <em>did</em> they pronounce the names Jesus, Jacob and Jerusalem&#063;</p>

      <p>Beyond these questions, the significance of the Geneva Bible can not be overstated.</p>

      <p>The Geneva Bible is the most revolutionary of all English Bibles, it was the first English version to be translated entirely from the original languages, it was read by William Shakespeare when he wasn't writing a tragedy, and it was brought to America by the Puritans riding on the Mayflower thus greatly influencing the colonial culture of early American life. <sup id="fnref:1.4" class="footnote"><a href="/about#fn:1.4">4</a>,</sup> <sup id="fnref:1.5" class="footnote"><a href="/about#fn:1.5">5</a></sup></p>

      <p>The rest of this site reflects my interest in all things &#0147;Jack&#0148;&#045; a labour of love, maybe an obsession, or simple boredom, I don&#039;t really know.</p>
