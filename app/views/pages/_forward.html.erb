      <p>A little blasphemous maybe, but it&#039;s as good a place to start as any.... You see, the letter &#147;j&#148; is absent from this bible, it hadn&#039;t even been invented yet&#033; I&#039;m wondering how they spelled Jesus&#063; And, if they didn&#039;t use the letter &#147;j&#148;, which has a &#147;dzh&#148; sound, how did they pronounce names like Jacob&#063;</p>

    <div class="span4">
      <p>Beyond these questions, the significance of this bible can not be overstated. The Geneva Bible is the most revolutionary of all English Bibles, it was the first English version to be translated entirely from the original languages, it was read by William Shakespeare when he wasn't writing a tragedy, and it was brought to America by the Puritans riding on the Mayflower thus greatly influencing the colonial culture of early American life. <sup id="fnref:1.2" class="footnote"><a href="/about#fn:1.2">2</a></sup></p>
