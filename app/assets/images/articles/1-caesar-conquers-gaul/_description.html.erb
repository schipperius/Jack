    <p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauls">Gauls</a> were a Celtic people living in the region roughly corresponding to what is now France, Belgium, Switzerland and Northern Italy. The countries of Gaul were civilized and wealthy.</p>
    <p>In 58 BC, Gaius Julius Caesar was heavily in debt and decided to conquer and plunder some territories to help get himself out of debt, it is likely that Gaul was not his initial target, but that did not stop him from waging a series of military campaigns against several Gallic Tribes.
    </p>
    <p>These <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_wars" target="_blank" title="Gallic Wars">Gallic wars</a> as they became known, ended in 52 BC with a Roman victory in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Alesia" target="_blank" title="Battle of Alesia">Battle of Alesia</a>, led by none other than Gaius Julius Caesar. This was a significant military victory for the Romans, resulting in the expansion of the Roman Republic over the whole of Gaul, and pushing their northern border to the river Rhine.

    <p>I am standing here on the coast of the North Sea at the mouth of the Oude Rijn, an ancient branch of the Rhine river that flows through the present day Dutch provinces of Utrecht and South Holland.

    <p>It is here at&nbsp;
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katwijk_aan_Zee">
        Katwijk aan Zee</a>
      &nbsp;that a Roman fortification known as&nbsp;
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittenburg">
        Brittenburg</a>
      &nbsp;emerged out of the sand after a storm in 1520 and a couple more times in 1552 and 1562, only to mysteriously disappear again.<p>
    <p>Brittenburg was the western most position of the Roman border defensive line, having been built along the river Rijn after Caesar's conquest of Gual in 52 BC.
    </p>
    
    <p>I am standing here at the mouth of the Oude Rijn, a branch of the Rhine river that flows through the Dutch provinces of Utrecht and South Holland. It is this river, that formed the Northern border of the Roman Empire around 52 BC.<sup class="footnote fn7"><a href="/author#fn7">[7]</a></sup></p>

    <p>The northern border of the Roman Empire was known as the Limes Germanicus<sup class="footnote fn8"><a href="/author#fn8">[8]</a></sup>, a line of fortifications that stretched from the North Sea at Katwik, following the natural boundary of the Lower Rhine branches, that included the modern Oude Rijn, and followed the Rhine to its source in the Swiss Alps.
    </p>

    <p>The Limes Germanicus was designed to protect the newly acquired lands from the raiding Germanic tribes from which I originate.</p>

    <p>For around 450 years, from around 55 BC to around 410 AD, the southern part of the Netherlands was integrated into the Roman Empire. During this time the Romans in the Netherlands had an enormous influence on the lives and culture of the people who lived in the Netherlands at the time and (indirectly) on the generations that followed.
    </p>
    <p>So, I was born within 30Km of the northern border of the Roman Empire.
