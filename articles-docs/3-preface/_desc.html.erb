located somewhere in the vast emptiness of the barren Canadian prairies, where I could see, uninterrupted, from one horizon to the other.

            <p>Sitting at a monthly staff meeting with Halloween fast approaching, the discussion turned to the various activities and festivities being planned.</p>

            <p>The usual Halloween Dance, door decorating contests (my grade seven homeroom won that year&#033;), classroom parties with apple bobbing contests, and so on.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, as I tuned out of the immediate conversation (I was never really that interested anyway), I began thinking about that orange squash that gets carved up annually, every fall, but could not for the life of me remember what it was called.</p>

            <p>I thought... Jacklight, Jack Frost, jack knife, Jack and Jill... I knew it was Jack something&#033;</p>

            <p>I began writing: Jack the ripper, Jack and the beanstalk, Jack fruit, Jackass... a colleague sitting on my right noticed my distraction, I explained my perturbed-ness and she politely replied, 'Jack 'o Lantern'.</p>

            <p>Oh ya, that was it&#033;</p>

            <p>But by now, I had half a page of words and phrases that had Jack in it: jack off, jack shit, jack rabbit, Jack Horner, jack ass (I wrote that one twice&#033;). People, games, animals, plants, and other sorted things, how did this all happen&#63;</p>

            <p>I reached for a dictionary<sup class="footnote fn2"><a href="/preface#fn2">[2]</a></sup> from the shelf behind me, the letter J it said, '...is the tenth letter of the alphabet, and the last of the 26 letters to be included.' So I looked up the word Jack, and found: every-man-jack, jack-a-dandy, jack-a-roo, Jack Ketch, jack ladder, jack leg.</p>

            <p>And thus began my quest, to understand the origin and usage of the word Jack.</p>

            <p>A journey that would take me back to the Egyptian hieroglyphs and the Old Testament, the Semites and Phoenicians, the 1358 French Revolt and the rest of the Middle Ages, the Dutch Printers and the King James Bible, the Industrial Revolution, botany, zoology and even some geology, famous people (and some not so famous), the kitchen and even the garage.</p>
